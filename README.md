# chimoney
Chimoney frontend assessment

Choice of React Framework used in this project is **Next.JS**.

Next.Js was chosen due to its completeness as a Framework. It has its own Router, performs SSR , uses file structure routing e.t.c

Features Implemented includes :

- Retrieval of data from Chimoney Api ( benefits , ecommerce and giftcards )
- Addition of items to the cart , cart page and complete checkout experience

Routes:
- This is a single page applications, all routes are either on stamped onto a modal or the apps original landing page.

Design Approach:
- Approach used in implementing this was based on a rather minimalistic approach. 
- All extra pages ( i.e, product, checkout , cart ) are referred to as modal pages to keep app simple.

Performance Improvement:
- Performance improvement would be to neccessitate to the of presisted data, i,e , by using redux store to save the data.
- Pagination has already been implemented here so, it won't be necessary.
